# ArtemisFinancial
•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a banking company who wanted to create an app that can be used across the world for customers to access their banking information. Artemis Financial requires a secure platform that protects sensitive user data and adheres to governmental requirements around the world. 

•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I was able to suggest a mitigation plan that would update the company’s frameworks and dependencies eliminating most of the vulnerabilities. I also was able to recommend ways to create code that was more secure. Software security is crucial to a company’s overall wellbeing. It is mandatory that sensitive user data, like financial information, is always secure or customer’s would no longer trust the client and the result could be detrimental. 

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found integrating the Maven tool initially challenging, as I ran into many system errors. Once I got past that though I found the Maven tool incredibly helpful in determining where vulnerabilities were. 

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by upgrading to more secure frameworks and dependencies and improving code so that it was written in a more secure manner. I would use the Maven static testing tool in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques. The Maven tool is thorough, easy to use, and easy to understand. 

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I would continuously run the code after each change was made to ensure the code ran with no errors. After refactoring and confirming the code runs as expected, I would re-run the Maven static testing tool to ensure that I did not add any additional vulnerabilities to the code. 

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

We used Eclipse a lot during this course and I was introduced to some parts of Eclipse that I had never used before. Definitely enjoyed learning the environment a little better. I also would use the Maven static testing tool in the future to test for vulnerabilities and create mitigation plans. 

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

This assignment would show future employer’s that I am a dedicated learner. Coming into this course my knowledge on software security was very limited. After only 4 weeks in the course I was able to integrate well known static testing tools, determine vulnerabilities, and create a mitigation plan. My dedication to learning will reflect my dedication to work when I am in the field.
