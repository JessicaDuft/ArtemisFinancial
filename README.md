Please review the attached document, [Software Security Vulnerability Assessment ](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/ArtemisFinancial/blob/main/Software_security_Artemis_Financial.docx)  , to see how I implemented security measures to the banking application Artermis Financial. I completed this project in CS-305 Software Security where I learned fundamental principles of software security

# ArtemisFinancial

Artemis Financial is a banking company who wanted to create an app that can be used across the world for customers to access their banking information. Artemis Financial requires a secure platform that protects sensitive user data and adheres to governmental requirements around the world. 



I was able to suggest a mitigation plan that would update the company’s frameworks and dependencies eliminating most of the vulnerabilities. I also was able to recommend ways to create code that was more secure. Software security is crucial to a company’s overall wellbeing. It is mandatory that sensitive user data, like financial information, is always secure or customer’s would no longer trust the client and the result could be detrimental. 



I found integrating the Maven tool initially challenging, as I ran into many system errors. Once I got past that though I found the Maven tool incredibly helpful in determining where vulnerabilities were. 



I increased layers of security by upgrading to more secure frameworks and dependencies and improving code so that it was written in a more secure manner. I would use the Maven static testing tool in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques. The Maven tool is thorough, easy to use, and easy to understand. 


I would continuously run the code after each change was made to ensure the code ran with no errors. After refactoring and confirming the code runs as expected, I would re-run the Maven static testing tool to ensure that I did not add any additional vulnerabilities to the code. 



We used Eclipse a lot during this course and I was introduced to some parts of Eclipse that I had never used before. Definitely enjoyed learning the environment a little better. I also would use the Maven static testing tool in the future to test for vulnerabilities and create mitigation plans. 



This assignment would show future employer’s that I am a dedicated learner. Coming into this course my knowledge on software security was very limited. After only 4 weeks in the course I was able to integrate well known static testing tools, determine vulnerabilities, and create a mitigation plan. My dedication to learning will reflect my dedication to work when I am in the field.
